## Available scripts:
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start` or `yarn start`
Starts a Node.js server using the Express framework. When the command is run, Node.js reads the "server.js" file and starts the Express server, allowing the server to respond to incoming HTTP requests.

### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
Starts the Express server with Nodemon, and restarts it whenever any changes are detected, making the development process more convenient and efficient.

## Folder structures:

### `service`:
Contains files which contains functions for handle API logic.

### `utils`:
Contains helper functions for reusing and making code much cleaner

### `.env`
Contains values that are responsible for config logic through the project.

### `XXX.config.js`
Contains the config logic for setup `XXX` library or third-parties.
